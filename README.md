This is a game for kids using C# Winform

This is my first project about C#, so in spite of using as least panel as posible, I used 1 function per panel, so It's kinda difficult to see, but It's really easy to control

About music, please change it from .mp3 ro .wav, I want to use file .wav but Github do not accept. You could search Google with keyword ".mp3 to .wav converter"
